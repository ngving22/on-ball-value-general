This notebook demonstrates how to value on-the-ball actions of football players with the open-source VAEP framework using the publicly available Wyscout match event dataset. The Wyscout dataset includes data for the 2017/2018 English Premier League, the 2017/2018 Spanish Primera Divisi√≥n, the 2017/2018 German 1. Bundesliga, the 2017/2018 Italian Serie A, the 2017/2018 French Ligue 1, the 2018 FIFA World Cup, and the UEFA Euro 2016. Covering 1,941 matches, 3,251,294 events and 4,299 players, the dataset is large enough to train machine-learning models and obtain robust ratings for the players.
